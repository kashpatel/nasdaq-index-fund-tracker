# Scotiabank Nasdaq Index Fund Price Tracker

An overnight cron job run by Github Action which emails me everyday price of the Scotiabank Nasdaq Index mutual fund.

## Why?

Matual fund prices are not real-time and only updated end of the day or overnight which makes harder to keep track of them each day.
